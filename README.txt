This project is a compilation of simpler Python scripts using Python's 3.50+ versions. Below are descriptions of the current scripts included in the project:



# Completed scripts
PygLatin: takes an input word and converts it into Pig Latin.


# Scripts in progress
TypoglycemiaGenerator: takes in an input text file and switches words around following the rules of typoglycemia, where internal letters in words can be rearranged but still understood by readers.
